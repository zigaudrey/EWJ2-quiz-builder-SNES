EARTHWORM JIM 2 - SNES/SUPER NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM - QUIZ DATA FORMAT

Location in Rom: 3B33A - 3D44E (Hex)
Lenght: 8468 (Dec)

QUIZ DATA [Lenght = 8176 (Dec)]
73 *
{
	Question [Lenght: Varies]
	{ 
	1 Byte = Right Proposition (15 / 16 / 17)
	0-2 Bytes = 07 (Linebreak)
	2 Bytes = 01 XX (Start - XX = Position (Min = 01) )
	x Bytes =  Question
	{3 bytes = 07 01 XX (Line Break - XX = Position (Min = 01) )
	}

	1-2 Bytes = 07 Repeated (Line Break between Question and Propositions)

	Proposition [Lenght = Varies]
	3 * 
	{
	2 Bytes = 07 07
	1 Byte = 01
	1 Byte = Position (Min = 0B, Best is 0C)
	1 Byte = Button Sprites (18 = Y , 19 = B, 1A = A)
	x Bytes = Proposition
	{3 bytes = 07 01 XX (Line Break - XX =Position)}
	}

1 Byte: 00 (End)
}

FOOTER DATA [Lenght = 292 (Dec)]
73 *
{
	4 Bytes = Pointer of the Question in the Rom (Little Endian) [XX XX C3 00] (Despise the confusion, the Data Offset is correct: 3A B3 03 00 (real pointer) is turned into 3A B3 C3 00 (pointer in the footer))
}

==============================================================

Question-Proposition lenght average is 112 bytes (8176 divided by 73)
Quiz Data can be shortened but has to be filled to get the same lenght

The recommanded Question Lenght for each line is between 26 - 28 characters
The recommanded Proposition Lenght for each line is between 12 - 16 characters (12 If you won't to over lay with the quiz machine)

Max Lines used is 15 (Based on "Does Jim's mother approves of the girls he dates?"), thus max is 6 % symbols

Outside the max lenght change, there aren't much differences from the Sega Genesis version. I believe the base data is the SNES one as it has the shortest max lenght.
